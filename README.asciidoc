bookmarks
---------
Generates a static HTML view of tagged bookmarks. Like a social,
synchronized bookmark storage service (e.g. delicious) except you
provide the synchronization and storage and it isn't social.

Utilizes the super-cool https://github.com/cgrand/enlive[Enlive] HTML
templating library.

Usage
-----
. Make an HTML template to format your bookmarks in the desired
  fashion (see +example/template.html+)
. Keep track of your bookmarks in a Clojure map structure (see
  +example/marks.clj+)
.. Add elements to this map structure manually or via the program
   itself
. Use the program to translate your bookmark-map into a static web
  page

Installation
------------
Download the standalone jar and run directly, or

. Install https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen[Leiningen]
. +lein uberjar+ from the project directory to build the jar
